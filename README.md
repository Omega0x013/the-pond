I originally developed this game for my Level 4 coursework while studying Software Engineering at the [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/). A version of it without the coursework-specific boilerplate can be found in [Release 1.0](https://github.com/Omega0x013/the-pond/releases/tag/1.0).

The coursework brief was to design a [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) pet. The pet needed to have a name and could become hungry, tired, and unclean. The user had to be able to interact with their pet to raise its stats, and the pet had to die if the stats got too low.

My pet was a frog that could hop between lily pads on a pond. Each hop cost 1% stamina, and stamina would fully recover after 1 hour. The frog could catch flies to refill its hunger. It also was required to have a cleanliness stat; the stats regressed over a set period. Each stat could also be restored using a corresponding item: a bottle of pills for staying awake, a cookie for filling up hunger, and a toothbrush for cleaning the frog.

## New Game

I've refactored and re-engineered the requirements since then...
